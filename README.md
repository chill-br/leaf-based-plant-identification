PROBLEM STATEMENT 
• Manual identification of medicinal plants is a time-consuming process and needs the help of the experts. 
• No dedicated model was prepared for the identification and classification and classification of medicinal plants found in Sikkim. 
• They rely heavily on the internet and are unable to function effectively without it.

Solution Approach 
The main module provides a range of functionalities for managing image uploads, processing, and plant identification. Specific features of this module include:
• Image Upload: Allows users to upload images of leaves for analysis.
• Preprocessing: Includes image preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance. 
• CNN Model: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model to analyse leaf images and identify plant species. 
• Identification Results: Displays the identification results, including the predicted plant species and confidence level. 
• User Profiles: Stores user information and history of uploaded images and identification results. 
• Feedback Mechanism: Allows users to provide feedback on the accuracy of the identification results to improve model performance. 
• Reports: Generates reports on usage statistics, model accuracy, and user feedback for further analysis and improvement.
